# ðŸŽ¯ Therapist Onboarding V2 - Comprehensive Improvement Plan

## Current State Evaluation

### What We Have Now:
1. **Quick Start Phase (3 steps):**
   - Step 1: Basic info & compliance
   - Step 2: Communication & Session styles
   - Step 3: Welcome

2. **Workspace Phase (5 steps):**
   - Specialties selection
   - Identity tags
   - Rates setting
   - Availability (basic)
   - Video upload

### Issues Identified:
- Too much critical matching data left for workspace phase
- Availability setup is too simplified
- Missing client management introduction
- Missing tasks system introduction
- Target elements not verified against real pages

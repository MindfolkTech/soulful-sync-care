```

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Keyword Extraction
**Function:** `parseStyleSentence()` in `/src/lib/matching.ts`

```javascript
// Input: "Warm and empathetic"
// Process: Split by spaces, normalize, lowercase
// Output: ['warm', 'empathetic']
```

### Storage Format
```sql
-- Example client_assessments record
{
  "communication_preferences": ["Warm and empathetic", "Structured and goal-oriented"],
  "therapy_goals": ["Anxiety and everyday worries", "Work and life stress"],
  "identity_preferences": ["Trauma-informed and gentle"],
  "therapy_modalities": ["CBT", "Mindfulness-based"],
  "budget_range": [50, 120],
  "preferred_times": ["Morning (9am-12pm)", "Evening (5pm-9pm)"],
  "gender_preferences": ["Female"],
  "age_group": "25-34"
}
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Required Fields**: None (all optional for flexibility)
2. **Max Selections**: 
   - therapy_goals: 7
   - communication_preferences: 3
   - identity_preferences: No limit
3. **Budget Range**: Min ¬£0, Max ¬£500
4. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Some options are mutually exclusive (handled in UI)

## Error Handling

- Empty selections default to no filtering on that dimension
- Invalid data types are sanitized before storage
- Network failures queue changes for retry
- Duplicate selections are automatically deduplicated

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Any changes to client selections MUST update:
1. This documentation
2. Assessment component options
3. FiltersDialog options
4. Database schema if needed
5. Matching algorithm keyword parsing

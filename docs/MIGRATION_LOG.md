## 2025-09-29: RLS Performance Optimization

**Migration File:** `20250929_fix_rls_performance_issues.sql`
**Rollback File:** `20250929_rollback_fix_rls_performance_issues.sql`
**Verification File:** `20250929_verify_rls_performance_fixes.sql`
**Guide:** `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE_20250929_RLS_PERFORMANCE.md`

### Changes Made
Fixed two critical performance issues identified by Supabase performance advisors:

1. **Auth RLS InitPlan Issues (43 warnings)**
   - Wrapped all `auth.uid()` calls with `(SELECT auth.uid())`
   - Changes queries from per-row evaluation (O(n)) to per-query evaluation (O(1))
   - Affects 17 tables with RLS policies

2. **Multiple Permissive Policies (105 warnings)**
   - Consolidated duplicate and redundant RLS policies
   - Reduced total policies from ~60 to ~42 (30% reduction)
   - Maintains exact same security behavior

### Tables Affected
1. profiles - Auth optimization
2. therapist_applications - Auth optimization
3. therapist_profiles - Auth + consolidated 3 SELECT → 1
4. client_assessments - Auth + removed 6 duplicates → 3 policies
5. appointments - Auth + consolidated 3 SELECT → 1
6. session_earnings - Auth optimization
7. client_session_notes - Auth + consolidated SELECT
8. therapist_analytics - Auth optimization
9. therapist_availability - Auth optimization
10. therapist_blocked_times - Auth optimization
11. client_testimonials - Auth + consolidated 5 → 2 policies
12. audit_trail - Auth + consolidated 4 SELECT → 1
13. moderation_queue - Auth + consolidated policies
14. notifications - Auth optimization
15. favorites - Auth optimization
16. support_tickets - Auth + consolidated policies
17. identity_tags - Auth in admin policy

### Expected Performance Impact
- **Query Speed:** 50-80% faster at scale
- **CPU Usage:** Reduced database CPU usage
- **Scalability:** Better with 1000+ concurrent users

### Testing Status
- [ ] Manual: Migration run in browser SQL editor
- [ ] Manual: Verification queries show "ALL ISSUES FIXED"
- [ ] Manual: Client can sign in and browse therapists
- [ ] Manual: Client can view own profile and assessment
- [ ] Manual: Therapist can view and update own profile
- [ ] Manual: Therapist can view dashboard
- [ ] Automated: Verification script passes all checks
- [ ] Performance: Query performance improved (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

### Security Verification
- [ ] No users report seeing unauthorized data
- [ ] No users report access denied to authorized data
- [ ] RLS still enabled on all tables (except taxonomy)
- [ ] Admin functions still work correctly
- [ ] is_admin() helper function still works

### PRD Updates
No changes to PRD required - this is pure performance optimization with no functional changes.

### Notes
- Migration wraps all auth.uid() calls for better performance
- Consolidates redundant policies without changing security behavior
- Fully reversible with provided rollback file
- No breaking changes to application code
- No changes to user-facing features

### Rollback Procedure
If issues occur:
1. Run `20250929_rollback_fix_rls_performance_issues.sql` in SQL Editor
2. Restores all original 60 policies with naked auth.uid() calls
3. Returns to baseline performance (slower but working)
4. Document issue before attempting migration again

## Migration Best Practices

### Before Running Migration
1. Read migration file and understand changes
2. Verify rollback file exists and is complete
3. Check current database state matches expectations
4. Ensure no other migrations are in progress
5. Have testing plan ready

### After Running Migration
1. Run verification queries immediately
2. Check for any database errors in Supabase logs
3. Test critical user flows in application
4. Monitor for user reports of issues
5. Update this log with testing results

### If Migration Fails
1. **DO NOT PANIC** - rollback file available
2. Take screenshot of error message
